At the Icahn Institute, our vision is to integrate the digital universe of information to better diagnose, treat, and prevent disease. The Icahn Institute was founded in 2011 to help advance precision medicine with cutting-edge technologies, novel partnerships between the public and private sector, and world class computational and analytical resources. At Mount Sinai, our research and clinical teams work together to translate research insights to improve patient diagnostics and treatment.
