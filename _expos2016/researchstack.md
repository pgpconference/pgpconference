[ResearchStack](http://researchstack.org/) makes it easy to build research study apps on Android, as well as adapt existing iOS ResearchKit(TM) apps to Android. ResearchStack provides an opinionated framework for informing participants and establishing consent, capturing participant survey data and other mobile sensor inputs, and securely managing data in a way that provides a straightforward pathway for securing IRB approval. The software is open source, community-driven, and maintained by [Cornell Tech](https://tech.cornell.edu/)â€™s [Small Data Lab](http://smalldata.io/) and [Open mHealth](http://www.openmhealth.org/) in collaboration with [touchlab](http://www.touchlab.co/).
