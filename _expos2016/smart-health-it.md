[SMART Health IT](http://smarthealthit.org/) is the interface between healthcare data and innovation. The goal is audacious: an innovative app developer can write an app once, and expect that it will run anywhere in the health care system. Further, that one app should be readily substitutable for another. When apps are substitutable, they compete with each other, which drives up quality and down price. The project includes the SMART Gallery, API, Genomics API and the SMART CDS-Hooks decision support framework.
