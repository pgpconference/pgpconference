[C3-PRO](http://researchkit.org/blog.html#article-10): Consent, Contact, and Community framework for Patient Reported Outcomes is a "backend" connecting any ResearchKit app to a widely-used clinical research IT infrastructure called i2b2. C3-PRO relies FHIR (Fast Health Interoperability Resources). We are making C3-PRO available to the broader research community to be used with their ResearchKit apps and also integrating with ResearchStack.
