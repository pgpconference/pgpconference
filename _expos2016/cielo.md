[CIELO](https://cielo.bmi.osumc.edu:8443/login/auth) provides members of the research community an open-source/-standards “app store” for data analysis and software sharing. The CIELO site provides a place to access useful applications for health research, contribute your own work in a citable, reusable format, and build and collaborate in a virtual environment by extending or assembling modules in new analytical “pipelines.” The project embodies the principles of open science and aims to establish a well-functioning community and platform that will reduce time and cost of research while enhancing the reproducibility and transparency of data analysis.
