**Steven Keating** is a doctoral candidate at the MIT Media Lab who is developing [novel platforms](http://matter.media.mit.edu/people/bio/steven-keating) for 3D printing, synthetic biological fabrication, and designed growth of the next generation of products. Curiosity drives his research and also saved his life through the accidental discovery of a baseball-sized cancerous brain tumor found in a voluntary academic scan. With his tumor successfully removed through awake brain surgery in 2014, Steven is an [advocate for open patient data](http://news.mit.edu/2015/student-profile-steven-keating-0401) and curiosity. From gears to genomes, he is interested in exploring new design possibilities, open health data networks, and asking if we can have a “share” button for health.
