<p>The GET Conference is preceded by a uniquely interactive event on April 25th called GET Labs + Expo.  Anyone can sign-up for <strong>GET Labs</strong>, where you get the opportunity to experience some of the best participatory health research studies available today. You can advance human health and disease research through direct participation in up to 17 different studies. <strong>GET Expo</strong> is a forum designed especially for researchers interested in learning about new tools and services that support the execution of successful participatory research studies. We know how challenging this can be, so we provide space for people with solutions and experience to come together. Details listed below.</p>

<p>Interested in attending Labs+Expo on April 25th?<br />

In the last few years, radical advances in DNA sequencing have allowed us to examine—for the first time—the full extent of microbial diversity on or in our bodies and to explore possible linkages between microbes and a wide range of health and disease states. At <a href="http://americangut.org/">American Gut</a>, the gut is our main focus, but we also look at oral, skin and even vaginal microbial communities.</p>

           <div class="lab-about"><p>The age of personalized genomics offers an unprecedented chance to understand the biology of uniquely human traits. One interesting and understudied human-specific trait is the areola, a circle of specialized, pigmented skin surrounding the human nipple. Areolas have been proposed to play an intriguing role in human evolution; different features of the areola have been linked to sexual selection, nursing behavior, and infant weight gain. Developmentally, circular markings have a simple genetic architecture. This means that studying areolas can help us learn about the genetic underpinnings of distinctively human traits, while also laying important groundwork for improving breast and infant health.</p>

It can also indicate the presence of other medical conditions, including autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases. Surprisingly, 150 years after temperature became a “vital sign” taken at every medical encounter, we still know very little about fever. <a href="http://feverprints.com/">Feverprints</a> aims to understand how body temperatures differ between individuals of different backgrounds, ages, sizes, gender and time of day in order to redefine what “normal” and “febrile” temperatures are. Secondly, we seek to identify specific fever patterns (“feverprints”) for different illnesses that will allow doctors to make quicker and more accurate diagnoses. Finally, we look to determine the effect of antipyretics (medicines to decrease fever) on the severity and length of an illness.</p>

Recent advances in genetic technology now could make it possible to determine the sequence of every immune molecule in the human population. As such, the Human Vaccines Project has proposed a flagship program, Human Immunome Project to define the sequence of all of these molecules, providing a definitive road map for design of new vaccines optimally configured to use the immune molecules available in humans to respond to vaccines.

The study interrogated aspects of this movement disorder through surveys and frequent sensor-based recordings from participants with and without Parkinson disease. These measurements provide the ability to explore classification of control participants and those who self-report having PD, as well as to begin to measure the severity of PD for those with the disease. Benefitting from large enrollment and repeated measurements on many individuals, these data may help establish baseline variability of real-world activity measurement collected via mobile phones, and ultimately may lead to quantification of the ebbs-and-flows of Parkinson symptoms.</p>

Participants will submit a urine sample for analysis that will be tested for a group of chemicals including antimicrobials, parabens, and phthalates and will receive a report of their results. We will use these data to characterize the public’s exposure to toxic chemicals, identify predictors of high exposure, and find the best ways to avoid exposure.</p>

Biologists have come to realize that microbes might have influenced the development of human social behavior, because close interactions facilitate the exchange of microbes between different hosts. The Preference Project collects information on human preferences and social norms to investigates the influence of the microbiome on the development of human social preferences and behavior. After completion of the study, participants will receive detailed feedback on their measured preferences and how they compare to the preferences of a representative sample of Americans.</p>
