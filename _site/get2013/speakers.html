As Founding Director of Planetree, a nonprofit consumer health care organization, she helped create a national model for humanizing hospitals, and a national model for providing health information to the public, the Planetree Resource Center. In 1995 she founded Direct Medical Knowledge (DMK). DMK was an extensive consumer health web site highly regarded for its unique content depth and innovative search interface. It was acquired by WebMD in 1999. She was also co-founder of the ALL Species Foundation in 2002, a global science initiative to discover all life on Earth, which evolved into the Encyclopedia of Life. She is on the board of PersonalGenomes.org.</p>

    <div class="speaker-bio"><p>Heidi Rehm, Ph.D., FACMG is the Chief Laboratory Director for the Laboratory for Molecular Medicine at the Partners Healthcare Center for Personalized Genetic Medicine and Assistant Professor of Pathology at Harvard Medical School. The lab focuses on the rapid translation of new genetic discoveries into clinical tests that can be used to improve patient outcomes, supporting the model of personalized medicine. Dr. Rehm is involved in defining standards for the use of next generation sequencing in clinical diagnostics through her committee roles at the American College of Medical Genetics and collaborative efforts with the CDC. Dr. Rehm is also involved in a major effort to develop and curate a universal clinical genomic variant database through collaborative efforts with NCBI and many other groups. Dr. Rehm also conducts research in hearing loss, Usher syndrome, cardiomyopathy, and healthcare IT.</p>

    <div class="speaker-bio"><p>Marc Salit is leading a group at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) dedicated to technology development and measurement infrastructure (standards, reference data, predictive models) for massively multiplexed genome-scale measurement methods. This “Multiplexed Biomolecular Science” group is a multidisciplinary team growing out of work to address microarray measurement science issues, and a long-running effort in technology and measurement science in microfluidics. Marc has worked extensively in measurement science in chemistry and physics, with emphasis on precision measurements, lab automation, algorithm development, measurement uncertainty, traceability, and standards development. His research is now focused on bringing experience from the chemical metrology community to the emerging biometrology community.</p>

    <div class="speaker-bio"><p>Stephen W. Scherer, PhD, DSc, FRSC is known for contributions to discovering the phenomena of global copy number variation (CNVs) of DNA and genes as the most abundant type of genetic variation in the human genome, Dr. Scherer leads one of Canada’s busiest laboratories. His group has discovered numerous disease susceptibility genes and most recently has defined CNV and other genetic factors underlying autism. He collaborated with Craig Venter’s team to decode human chromosome 7 and to generate the first genome sequence of an individual. Some 300 scientific papers document his work (cited &gt;20,000 times). Professor Scherer holds the GlaxoSmithKline-Canadian Institutes of Health Research Chair in Genetics and Genomics at The Hospital for Sick Children and University of Toronto.</p>

    <div class="speaker-bio"><p>Sharon F. Terry is President and CEO of Genetic Alliance, a network of more than 10,000 organizations, of which 1,200 are disease advocacy organizations. Genetic Alliance enables individuals, families and communities to reclaim their health and become full participants in translational research. She is the founding CEO of PXE International, a research advocacy organization for the genetic condition pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE). As co-discoverer of the gene associated with PXE, she holds the patent for ABCC6 to act as its steward and has assigned her rights to the foundation. She developed a diagnostic test and conducts clinical trials. Terry is also a co-founder of the Genetic Alliance Registry and Biobank. She is the author of more than 100 peer-reviewed articles. In her focus at the forefront of consumer participation in genetics research, services and policy, she serves in a leadership role on many of the major international and national organizations.</p>

    <div class="speaker-bio"><p>Sarah Tishkoff, PhD is the David and Lyn Silfen University Professor in Genetics and Biology at the University of Pennsylvania. Dr. Tishkoff studies genomic variation in ethnically diverse Africans. Her research examines African population history and how genetic variation can affect a wide range of practical issues – for example, why humans have different susceptibility to disease, how they metabolize drugs, and how they adapt through evolution. Dr. Tishkoff is a recipient of an NIH Pioneer Award, a David and Lucile Packard Career Award, a Burroughs/Wellcome Fund Career Award and a Penn Integrates Knowledge (PIK) endowed chair.</p>
