<p>Some of the most well-characterized humans on earth attend GET Labs. Many of these omic astronauts have already obtained personal genome sequencing, had their microbiomes characterized at various bodily habitats, and know something about the average length of their telomeres. Attendees often look forward to the opportunity to spit, swab, or be poked, measured, and surveyed for the good of science. The prospect of gaining access to these pioneers (and their data!) attracts an increasing number of research groups to join us for this event and organize phenotyping booths, specimen collection stations, sensor distribution and other activities.</p>

<p><strong>Attendance at GET Labs is by invitation only</strong>. This is a separate event from GET Conference, although both events are intimate and many people do participate in both. There are three ways to seek an invitation to this event:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Research groups:</strong> <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Uwqmmp0ARwTmuEmgnwxIWeEE10NUpf3d8py2z8QJYsU/viewform">Apply to attend</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Harvard Personal Genome Project participants</strong>: Log-in and <a href="https://my.pgp-hms.org/third_party/18">apply to attend</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Event sponsors</strong>: Email jason@personalgenomes.org</li>
</ul>

<p>While we do anticipate growing this event to support much broader audiences, currently we are focused on bringing together well-informed volunteers with extensive public data and researchers who wish to study them. At this point, our attendees are drawn from the Harvard Personal Genome Project (PGP). The Harvard PGP now has a cohort of more than 3000 eager, enrolled participants. These well-characterized individuals are enthusiastic and willing to contribute to the advancement of science in astounding ways. Many of them already have open-access whole genome data, health records, microbiome data, and cell lines.</p>

           <div class="lab-about"><p>Ever since Antonie van Leeuwenhoek discovered a vast diversity of microbes between his own teeth in the 17th century using a primitive microscope, the microbes inhabiting our bodies have fascinated us. It is somewhat startling to realize that the human body has 10 times more non-human cells than 10 trillion human cells! It is only in the last few years that radical advances in DNA sequencing have allowed us to examine, for the first time, the full extent of microbial diversity on or in our bodies and to explore possible linkages between microbes and a wide range of health and disease states (including skin infections, neurological conditions, obesity, malnutrition, and inflammatory bowel disease).

           <div class="lab-about"><p>Although some may not admit it, we all have body odor. What you may not realize is that it isn’t you producing the odor, but it is the microscopic organisms living on you that produce your body odor. We are exploring microbial biodiversity on human skin (in the armpit) since the skin is the body’s first line of defense against pathogens and offers numerous opportunities to explore how a person’s microbial diversity can affect health and behavior. Our preliminary findings indicate that armpit product use significantly affects the microbes residing on the skin, but we have a lot to learn about how daily habits and underlying genetics influence the microbes living there. We will be sampling additional volunteers to identify correlations with health and daily habits, which will be greatly improved with datasets from PGP individuals.</p>

<p>Armpits are sexy and the smells produced by the microbes that live there may just help people choose their mate! We ask volunteers to go product-free for two days prior to sampling so we get a unique signature of the microbes living in the armpit without the inhibitory effects of products. Please stop by to learn more and to give us your sample! (Photo credit: Megan Ehlers)</p>

         <div class="lab-body">
           <div class="lab-about"><p>The age of personalized genomics offers an unprecedented chance to understand the biology of uniquely human traits. One interesting and understudied human-specific trait is the areola, a circle of specialized, pigmented skin surrounding the human nipple. Areolas have been proposed to play an intriguing role in human evolution; different features of the areola have been linked to sexual selection, nursing behavior, and infant weight gain. Developmentally, circular markings have a simple genetic architecture. This means that studying areolas can help us learn about the genetic underpinnings of distinctively human traits, while also laying important groundwork for improving breast and infant health.</p>

<p>The Tabin Laboratory at Harvard Medical School has engaged more than 200 participants from the Personal Genome Project to share data about their areolas as part of our effort to learn about the causes and consequences of diversity in this uniquely human trait. Using this data we have made several important discoveries: one, areolas are much more diverse than was previously recognized; and two, we now know that multiple, independent genetic pathways are responsible for the size and glandular structure of the areola.</p>

<p>We invite all PGP participants (both male and female) to join us in our effort to identify the genes responsible for variation in the appearance and glandular structure of the areola. Participation takes place in two parts. First, participants complete an online survey about health factors that could influence areola appearance, including weight, parity and breastfeeding history, hormonal status, etc. Second, participants perform a breast and areola self-characterization wherein they take measurements and photographs of their areolas (this is performed in the privacy of your own home). All measurements and images belong to participants and can be shared as you choose. In addition, all data will be uploaded to our secure server for analysis.</p>

<p>Please visit our 2014 GET Lab booth to pick up your areola self-characterization kit and to hear what we have been learning about the fascinating human areola. Not coming to GET Labs? We still want your help! If you are interested in participating in Circles, please read about the study and request a study kit by mail <a href="https://my.pgp-hms.org/third_party/12">here</a> (must be a Harvard PGP participant to access).</p>

           <div class="lab-about"><p>With your help, we aim to improve the design of websites and tools that make personal genomic information more accessible and understandable by the general public. We are academic researchers in the field of Human Computer Interaction that study opportunities and challenges for applying advanced HCI techniques in the area of personal genomics. We seek to learn more about the motivations, attitudes, and needs of users engaging with their personal genomic information. Thus, we look for volunteers who have already spent some time studying their own personal genomic data and want to tell us about their experiences.</p>

<p>We also plan to examine what human-computer interaction and visualization techniques and can help people to learn and generate new meaningful knowledge from their personal and family data. More specifically, we will explore how to design tools that enhance people’s understanding of their genomic data and help users to leverage the predictive mechanism of human health and disease, as well as how to design computational environments that facilitate novel models of collaboration between citizen and professional scientists, broadening the participation of the public in genomic investigations.(image credit: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/irglover/7096373457/sizes/c/">flickr user irglover</a>)</p>

             Flu Near You<br /></p>
         </div>
         <div class="lab-body">
           <div class="lab-about"><p>New genetic variants of influenza and other pathogens are rapidly emerging. Since 2000, avian influenza viruses (H5N1, H7N7, and H7N3), human metapneumovirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), coronavirus (CoV and human CoVs NL63 and HKU1, a new coronavirus (2012)), parvovirus types 4 and 5, mimivirus, H1N1 and initial cases of H3N2 and H1N2 in humans, have emerged and been identified. At the same time, global surveillance capacity has remained stagnant. Our current ability to estimate population-wide incidence of acute respiratory infection (ARI) and influenza-like illness (ILI) or measure the relative contributions of different pathogens to incidence are severely limited. Thus we at HealthMap, created Flu Near You (<a href="http://www.flunearyou.org">http://www.flunearyou.org</a>), an online participatory influenza surveillance tool for the USA and Canada.</p>

<p>Although the value of self-report systems such as Flu Near You have been demonstrated to engage individuals in the importance of influenza surveillance, enable them to access real-time information about what is directly happening in their community, and to generate detailed information about influenza risk for populations, none of the platforms have employed molecular techniques to rapidly verify the intelligence data garnered. Our goal is to enable Flu Near You participants who are willing to also provide samples for viral confirmation, to validate symptomatic reports as well as enable a better understanding of the representativeness of self-reported data and symptom profiles for different acute respiratory illnesses.</p>

             Genome In A Bottle Consortium Giab<br /></p>

         <div class="lab-body">
           <div class="lab-about"><p>As new high-throughput DNA sequencing methods are moving into clinical applications, understanding accuracy of genome sequencing instruments and methods will be critical. Numerous recent studies have demonstrated that analyzing the same sample on different sequencing technologies and bioinformatics analysis methods can yield very different results. There is a clear need for reference materials and quality metrics that may be used by device manufacturers and clinical laboratories to calibrate their machines and improve their operations.</p>

<p>With help from the Genome in a Bottle Consortium (www.genomeinabottle.org) and the FDA, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is developing well-characterized whole human genomes as Reference Materials. Research and clinical laboratories will be able to purchase and use these Reference Materials to understand and improve the performance of their DNA sequencing operations and bioinformatics methods.</p>

<p>The NIST “Genome in a Bottle” Consortium has partnered with PersonalGenomes.org and the Harvard Personal Genome Project (PGP) to identify well-consented participants interesting in contributing to this important effort. Specimens donated by PGP volunteers are viewed as ideal candidates to serve as these new reference standards due to the depth and availability of public PGP datasets as well as the strength of the “open consent” process used in the Harvard PGP study. In particular, the Harvard PGP consent process addresses the risk of re-identification and enables the commercial use of donated tissues.</p>

         <div class="lab-body">
           <div class="lab-about"><p>Generating research data is easier than ever before, but interpreting and analyzing it is still hard, and getting harder as the volume increases. This is especially true of genomics. Sequencing the whole genome of a single person produces more than 100 gigabytes of raw data, and a million genomes will add up to more than 100 petabytes.</p>

<p>This abundance of new information carries great potential for research and human health – and requires new standards, policies and technology. To contribute to the genomics community and help meet the data-intensive needs of the life sciences, Google recently introduced a simple web-based API to import, process, store, explore and collaborate with genomic data at “Google scale”.</p>

<p>With these first steps, it is our goal to make valuable data from projects like the Personal Genome Project widely accessible and useful. Together with the research community, we hope to improve access to larger sample sizes to distinguish between people who become sick and those who remain healthy, between patients who respond to treatment and those whose condition worsens, and between pathogens that cause outbreaks and those that are harmless. We aim to help researchers explore and analyze that information, even without access to a local supercomputer.</p>
