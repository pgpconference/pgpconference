[Mole Mapper](https://www.ohsu.edu/xd/health/services/dermatology/war-on-melanoma/mole-mapper.cfm) is a cellphone app built using Apple's ResearchKit. Using the iPhone camera, Mole Mapper tracks and quantitatively measures your moles over time and provides you with a reference map of your skin. With monthly reminders for re-measurement, the app aims for early detection of any abnormal mole growth. By sharing mole images, participants are empowering researchers to develop new ways to evaluate moles to better understand melanoma risk and early cancer detection.
