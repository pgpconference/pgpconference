The human body has an astounding capacity to recognize foreign pathogens using an enormous collection of diverse antibodies and cells in the immune system. Recent advances in genetic technology now could make it possible to determine the sequence of every immune molecule in the human population. As such, the Human Vaccines Project has proposed a flagship program, Human Immunome Project to define the sequence of all of these molecules, providing a definitive road map for design of new vaccines optimally configured to use the immune molecules available in humans to respond to vaccines. The goal is to compute the diversity of the repertoire in na√Øve B and T cells across the human population, with an initial target of defining 1,000 immunomes. image credit: [NIAID](https://www.flickr.com/photos/nasamarshall/13976152903/in/photolist-ni2rkv-cNzxdh-bo55zH-o16T6U-cNzEzb-nHKXVK-9y4sD6-cNA5L7-nHL6Do-nHJQ3A-su1V3i-sctDem-wyPJtV-nzKy5D-5LepXQ-dZUVg5-a4RLoY-xVc3HW-9y7kCs-piMqnb-8R2A51-5VLTZt-w1s1Ck-yZDUSm-5D3QVj-97GD84-AuWXoC-ainAP8-pGAGXn-rx2LVN-xvJ8TV-8DmreH-kyqeFi-q4o8ZF-o1S6AN-e46ww-6enjRC-dyzAgR-bpzjLX-bpzphi-dkkdZJ-dyF4DL-vMLopF-9FGf8L-dy4hzr-aqKCB-bkJSUL-9RQsfo-7x1eyT-9RQscb)
