[GoViral](https://www.goviralstudy.com/) enables volunteers to provide specimens when sick with respiratory or gastrointestinal infections. Participants receive profiling data from samples, potentially learning what type of virus they sampled. By sampling when symptoms occur, participants can validate symptomatic reports and further understanding of how self-reported data and symptom profiles relate to different illnesses. Aggregate, anonymous community data is also shared about what is circulating in your local community.
