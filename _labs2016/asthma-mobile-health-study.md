With apps powered by Appleâ€™s new ResearchKit, you can easily participate in medical research studies and help contribute to improving healthcare. Our team at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai invites you to join our Asthma Mobile Health study. This app is a personalized tool that helps you to gain greater insight into your asthma, avoid triggers, adhere to treatment plans, and take charge of your health. The Asthma Health app helps you to track your asthma symptoms, allows you to review trends, gives you feedback on your progress, and provides personalized reminders to take your prescribed medications. The Asthma Health app has even added new features that allow you to share information collected on the app with your doctor.
