The [Boston Stress Study](http://bostonstressstudy.com/) will build a normative dataset to investigate the human costs of acute and chronic stress. Our technologies measure the continuous physiology of stress and rest tied to contextual factors from mobile phones to visualize real-time effects of daily life stressors. By focusing on Bostonâ€™s diverse range of demographics, professions, and lifestyles across neighborhoods and socioeconomics, we are quantifying how stress and rest affect our health, productivity, and performance.
