In March 2015, Sage Bionetworks launched [mPower](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/parkinson-mpower-study-app/id972191200?mt=8), an observational smartphone-based study developed using Appleâ€™s [ResearchKit](http://www.apple.com/researchkit/) library, to evaluate the feasibility of remotely collecting frequent information about the daily changes in symptom severity and their sensitivity to medication in PD. The study interrogated aspects of this movement disorder through surveys and frequent sensor-based recordings from participants with and without Parkinson disease. These measurements provide the ability to explore classification of control participants and those who self-report having PD, as well as to begin to measure the severity of PD for those with the disease. Benefitting from large enrollment and repeated measurements on many individuals, these data may help establish baseline variability of real-world activity measurement collected via mobile phones, and ultimately may lead to quantification of the ebbs-and-flows of Parkinson symptoms.
