Social norms and social preferences affect the way we interact with others everyday. Biologists have come to realize that microbes might have influenced the development of human social behavior, because close interactions facilitate the exchange of microbes between different hosts. The Preference Project collects information on human preferences and social norms to investigates the influence of the microbiome on the development of human social preferences and behavior. After completion of the study, participants will receive detailed feedback on their measured preferences and how they compare to the preferences of a representative sample of Americans.
