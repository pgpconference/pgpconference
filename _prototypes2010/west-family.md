John, Judy, Anne & Paul West are the first family of four to have their genomes sequenced while in good health, specifically to look for medical issues before symptoms appear (Illumina Personal Genome Service, 2009). Mr. West is currently CEO of Novocell, Inc, a stem cell engineering company focused on diabetes. He was previously CEO of the DNA sequencing company Solexa and first worked on DNA sequencing automation in 1982. Anne West is a junior at the Harker High School in Saratoga, CA. She will speak on the familyâ€™s experience with personal genome sequencing.
