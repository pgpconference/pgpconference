Right now, the genes + environment = health equation is a [fiddler crab](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiddler_crab) -- with a large and growing “gene arm” and only a tiny knowledge base about all the chemical exposures we encounter in a lifetime. We invite all Personal Genome Project participants to help us in a study about putting personal environmental exposure data online. Participation consists of a half-hour interview. As a PGP participant already helping to accelerate discoveries about the human genome, you can help inform a parallel effort to understand the human “exposome” – an individual’s environmental exposures, beginning in the womb.

We want to learn about your experiences participating in a study that involved sharing genetic data on the web, your decision to join the study, and your views about how researchers should handle study data to both advance science and protect any data that study participants want to keep private. This study is being conducted by a team of researchers from Silent Spring Institute, Northeastern University, and Harvard University, and is funded by the National Institutes of Health. Your responses will be kept confidential. As a thank you, the first twenty people to schedule and complete an interview will receive a free Public Laboratory desktop spectrometer, an experimental device for citizen scientists to analyze and compare material spectra – "fingerprints". You can sign up for an interview via our [calendar](https://skedge.me/get2013exposome). If you have any questions about the study, please contact Oscar Zarate at 617-332-4288 ext. 232 or zarate@silentspring.org.
