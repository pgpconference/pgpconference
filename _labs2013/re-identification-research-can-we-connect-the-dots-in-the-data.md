Before the GET conference we attempted to link names to PGP profiles. Drop by our table and see if we correctly identified you to your profile. We can tell you how we did it and what you can do to stop others from doing the same while still keeping your profile useful for research. We are the [Data Privacy Lab](http://dataprivacylab.org) at Harvard University.
