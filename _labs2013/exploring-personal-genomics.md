Rapid advances in high-throughput genome sequencing technologies foreshadow a near-future in which millions of individuals will gain affordable access to their complete genome sequence. This promises to offer unprecedented insights into the fundamental biological nature of ourselves and our species: where we came from, how we begin our lives, how we develop and grow, how we interact with our environment, how we get sick, how we get well, and how we age. Personal genomics is an essential component of the inevitable transition towards personalized and participatory health and medicine.

This workshop explores a novel, inquiry-based approach to understanding and interpretation of the practical, medical, physiological, and societal aspects of personal genomic information. Participants will gain an understanding of the biology of human genomes, information on how to obtain and understand digital representations of personal genomic data, tools and techniques for exploring the personal genomics of ancestry and genealogy, discovery and interpretation of genetic trait associations, and the role of personal genomics in drug response. Participants will also explore advanced topics in personal genome analysis, such as drawing connections between a personal genome and the environment, connecting DNA to physiology, and assessing rare variants. Participants are encouraged to bring their own personal genomic information, as the instructors will demonstrate specific examples using the interpretome platform (http://www.interpretome.com) and other freely available tools for exploring personal genomes.
