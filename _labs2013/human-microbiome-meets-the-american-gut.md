Ever since Antonie van Leeuwenhoek discovered a vast diversity of microbes between his own teeth in the 17th century using a primitive microscope, the microbes inhabiting our bodies have fascinated us. It is somewhat startling to realize that the human body has 10 times more non-human cells than 10 trillion human cells! It is only in the last few years that radical advances in DNA sequencing have allowed us to examine, for the first time, the full extent of microbial diversity on or in our bodies and to explore possible linkages between microbes and a wide range of health and disease states (including skin infections, neurological conditions, obesity, malnutrition, and inflammatory bowel disease).

The sampling procedure is relatively simple. We are asking PGP volunteers to sample microbes from multiple sites in the body using sterile q-tips. We may also ask volunteers to record any features of diet, medications (e.g. antibiotics), and other factors that could influence the microbial communities.
