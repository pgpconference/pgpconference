Although the value of self-report systems such as Flu Near You have been demonstrated to engage individuals in the importance of influenza surveillance, enable them to access real-time information about what is directly happening in their community, and to generate detailed information about influenza risk for populations, none of the platforms have employed molecular techniques to rapidly verify the intelligence data garnered. Our goal is to enable Flu Near You participants who are willing to also provide samples for viral confirmation, to validate symptomatic reports as well as enable a better understanding of the representativeness of self-reported data and symptom profiles for different acute respiratory illnesses.

New genetic variants of influenza and other pathogens are rapidly emerging. Since 2000, avian influenza viruses (H5N1, H7N7, and H7N3), human metapneumovirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), coronavirus (CoV and human CoVs NL63 and HKU1, a new coronavirus (2012)), parvovirus types 4 and 5, mimivirus, H1N1 and initial cases of H3N2 and H1N2 in humans, have emerged and been identified. At the same time, global surveillance capacity has remained stagnant. Our current ability to estimate population-wide incidence of acute respiratory infection (ARI) and influenza-like illness (ILI) or measure the relative contributions of different pathogens to incidence are severely limited. Thus we at HealthMap, created Flu Near You ([http://www.flunearyou.org](http://www.flunearyou.org)), an online participatory influenza surveillance tool for the USA and Canada.
