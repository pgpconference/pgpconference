Go to [Map-Ed.org](http://www.pged.org/maped/) and work your way through five questions about key concepts in genetics to pin yourself on a world map. No expertise in genetics needed! Questions are multiple-choice, and you will be provided with fun facts along the way to point you toward the correct answer. Then, get your friends to play this game and see more pins popping up in your neighborhood. And...this is just the beginning! We will be adding questions from time to time so that you can pin yourselves in new and fun ways.
Check out our interactive map to see the pins that are there! Once you have pinned yourself, come back to this map as often as youâ€™d like to watch the pins filling in. Brought to you by the Personal Genetics Education Project (pgEd; [www.pgEd.org](http://www.pged.org/)).
