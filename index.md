<h2>About the GET Conference</h2>
<p>For the past six years, this event has explored the frontiers of understanding about human biology. It serves as an annual forum to debate the technical, commercial, and societal impacts of advances in our ability to measure and understand people and their traits.</p>

<p>The GET Conference is produced by PersonalGenomes.org, a 501(c)(3) charitable organization based in the United States whose mission is to make a wide spectrum of human biological information accessible and actionable to increase biological literacy and improve human health.  We support groundbreaking initiatives including the Global Network of Personal Genome Projects, Open Humans and the GET Conference.</p>
