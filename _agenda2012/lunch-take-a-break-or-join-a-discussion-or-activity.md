**"Personal genomics education: Take action in your community"**   Discussion session, 1:15-2:00pm (Room 258) [More details](http://www.pged.org/journal/2012/4/16/national-education-get-2012-session-with-dana-waring-and-chr.html)

Join Dana Waring, Education Director of the Personal Genetics Education Project (pgEd), and Chris Korey, Professor of Biology from the College of Charleston (also PGP participant #huA4F281) for a conversation about how you can contribute to personal genomics education. What insights do you have that could help accelerate public understanding of the advantages as well as complexities of knowing one's genome?  

In addition to exchanging ideas on the most pressing issues concerning the scientific and social implications of personal genetics, participants will leave with a set of tools to conduct formal and informal sessions that can educate the public in an unbiased manner. Our premise is that PGPers have a unique and powerful voice with which to engage the general public about the hopes, realities, and ethical nuances of personal genomics.
