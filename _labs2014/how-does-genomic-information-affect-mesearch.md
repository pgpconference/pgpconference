As a participant in the Personal Genome Project, you are a pioneer. The story of how you and others came to participate, your experiences as a participant and the ways participation has or could change things in your life are of great interest to experts in ethics and psychology. We are interested in how individuals utilize information about genes affecting their families. We would like to interview a wide range of participants about their PGP experiences. Interviews will be confidential, take 40-60 minutes, and occur at a time you choose. Data from the interviews and a larger survey we will develop based on the interviews will help us and others in consideration of how genomic research might be conducted in the future and help us to know how best to involve families in genomic research. Please stop by and talk with us at the GET conference. If you wonâ€™t be at the GET Conference, but would consider being interviewed, please send your name, email address and phone number to the project PI, Dr. Andrea Patenaude, at andrea_patenaude@dfci.harvard.edu and we will call you. We are happy to answer questions and, if you are willing, we will add you to the list of participants who will be contacted for interviews over the next few months. We have so much to learn from you!
