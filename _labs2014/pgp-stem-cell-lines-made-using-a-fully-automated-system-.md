[Induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_pluripotent_stem_cell) are derived from adult skin cells and can give rise to any cell type within the human body. This makes them a promising research focus for improving human health. PGP participants are a great resource for scientists, especially those studying stem cells, because their genome and other biological data can be shared publicly. The generation of iPS cell lines from PGP participants would have tremendous utility for the scientific community in both basic and clinical research by providing relevant information, inaccessible from other cohorts, that is related to the donor and can be linked to the iPS cell line. To ensure the longevity, quality, and consistency of the PGP iPS cell lines, they must be generated using high-quality, consistent procedures. The New York Stem Cell Foundation (NYSCF) Research Institute has developed robotic methods to create standardized cells, which help scientists understand when cell features are due to genetic or epigenetic differences (and not to the different techniques used to create the cell lines). By working together, NYSCF and PGP will create standard iPS cell lines whose data can be published publicly â€“ a great resource for the scientific community.

The NYSCF robotic platform, known as the NYSCF Global Stem Cell Array, is a new technology platform for the derivation and manipulation of stem cell lines as well as the differentiation of adult cell types in a high-throughput, parallel process using automation. Standardization and scale-up capabilities achieved through this automated process are critical in efforts to reduce methodological variability to uncover true biology by improving signal to noise ratios in phenotype studies. The automated system has the capacity to generate hundreds of stem cell lines per month allowing large-scale investigation into disease pathologies and drug toxicity and efficacy studies. The platform will generate panels of stem cell lines from thousands of genetically diverse individuals representing both diseased patients and controls.
