Siblings who share the same biological parents (and, by extension, the same ancestors) may self-identify differently when asked about race; may look quite different in terms of physical appearance (including skin color, eye color, hair color and texture, and facial features); may be perceived by others as having different ancestries; and may even have different proportional genomic ancestries. The relationships between race, identity, appearance, and genealogical, genomic, and perceived ancestry are not well understood. How individuals identify and are identified by others is shaped to an unknown degree by our expectations about how an individual of a particular ancestry “should” look. The level of discordance between an individual’s appearance, perceived ancestry, and proportional genomic ancestry may affect the formation and stability of an individual’s racial identity, the frequency and severity of discrimination the individual experiences, and even the individual’s own prejudices. By better understanding perceived ancestry, we may be able to develop effective tools to mitigate implicit prejudices in medical and legal contexts.

This phase of the “Multidisciplinary Study of Race, Ancestry, Appearance, Discrimination & Prejudice,” funded by the National Human Genome Research Institute’s Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications Program, explores how individuals conceptualize and visualize ancestry and variation in human faces. Using Survey Monkey instruments, participants are first asked background questions about themselves and then shown a set of 3D, animated facial images with corresponding questions. The facial images used as stimuli in the perception tasks are from individuals who agreed to participate in research related to perceiving ancestry and genes in facial features and for whom substantial information is available to compare with observers’ perceptions of ancestry.

This project dovetails a research project led by Dr. Mark Shriver at Penn State University. Participants of both studies may have additional ancestry perception task opportunities at GET Labs.
