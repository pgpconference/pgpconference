Generating research data is easier than ever before, but interpreting and analyzing it is still hard, and getting harder as the volume increases. This is especially true of genomics. Sequencing the whole genome of a single person produces more than 100 gigabytes of raw data, and a million genomes will add up to more than 100 petabytes.

This abundance of new information carries great potential for research and human health -- and requires new standards, policies and technology. To contribute to the genomics community and help meet the data-intensive needs of the life sciences, Google recently introduced a simple web-based API to import, process, store, explore and collaborate with genomic data at "Google scale".

With these first steps, it is our goal to make valuable data from projects like the Personal Genome Project widely accessible and useful. Together with the research community, we hope to improve access to larger sample sizes to distinguish between people who become sick and those who remain healthy, between patients who respond to treatment and those whose condition worsens, and between pathogens that cause outbreaks and those that are harmless. We aim to help researchers explore and analyze that information, even without access to a local supercomputer.
