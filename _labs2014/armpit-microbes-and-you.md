Although some may not admit it, we all have body odor. What you may not realize is that it isn’t you producing the odor, but it is the microscopic organisms living on you that produce your body odor. We are exploring microbial biodiversity on human skin (in the armpit) since the skin is the body’s first line of defense against pathogens and offers numerous opportunities to explore how a person’s microbial diversity can affect health and behavior. Our preliminary findings indicate that armpit product use significantly affects the microbes residing on the skin, but we have a lot to learn about how daily habits and underlying genetics influence the microbes living there. We will be sampling additional volunteers to identify correlations with health and daily habits, which will be greatly improved with datasets from PGP individuals.

Armpits are sexy and the smells produced by the microbes that live there may just help people choose their mate! We ask volunteers to go product-free for two days prior to sampling so we get a unique signature of the microbes living in the armpit without the inhibitory effects of products. Please stop by to learn more and to give us your sample! (Photo credit: Megan Ehlers)
