**Janet Freeman-Daily** MS, ENG, was diagnosed with advanced lung cancer in May 2011.  Despite two lines of conventional therapy (chemo and radiation), her cancer became metastatic.  She used information obtained in online patient communities to get her tumor tissue tested for newer molecular markers and find a targeted therapy clinical trial.  She is not cured, but has had No Evidence of Disease since January 2013.  She now uses her writing and speaking skills, MIT and Caltech degrees, and aerospace systems engineering background to translate the experience and science of lung cancer treatment and research, pursue improved quality of life and outcomes for lung cancer patients, and promote patient engagement and activism. Her accomplishments include writing science articles and an award-winning blog [grayconnections.net](http://grayconnections.net), co-moderating Lung Cancer Social Media (#LCSM) Chat on Twitter, participating in President’s Cancer Panel connected health workshops, speaking at cancer centers and medical conferences, and serving as a patient advocate on the University of Colorado Cancer Center Lung Cancer SPORE, the Addario Patient and Caregiver Advisory Board, and the eHealth Steering Committee at Virginia Mason Hospital in Seattle. She was named a Lung Hero by [LUNGevity](http://www.lungevity.org), and one of Seattle’s Most Influential People for 2015. Follow her [@JFreemanDaily](https://twitter.com/JFreemanDaily)
