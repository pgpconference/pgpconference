The [Platform for Engaging Everyone Responsibly](http://www.geneticalliance.org/programs/biotrust/peer) (PEER), from partners Genetic Alliance and Private Access, enables participants and their caregivers to share clinical information, medical records, and even genomic information - all within an environment that provides the look and feel of familiar, trusted communities under access-permission rules defined by the participants themselves. PEER provides data-entry, data-query, and privacy-management services that are accessed through standard application programming interfaces (APIs).
