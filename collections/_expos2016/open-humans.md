[Open Humans](https://www.openhumans.org/) can support your research study in several ways. First, some Open Humans members generously choose to publicly share their data -- a potentially valuable resource for you. Second, we can enable studies to work directly with Open Humans members to receive data (private as well as public) and enable additional follow-up research (e.g. surveys or new samples). Governance and technology to enable data sharing can be a challenge! We have know-how, tools and experience that can help you do this.
