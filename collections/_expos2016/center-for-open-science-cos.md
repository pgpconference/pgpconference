[COS](https://cos.io/) is a non-profit technology company providing free and open services to increase inclusivity and transparency of research. We support shifting incentives and practices to align more closely with scientific values. Our mission is to increase openness, integrity, and reproducibility of scientific research. COS pursues this mission by building communities around open science practices, supporting metascience research, and developing and maintaining free, open source software tools. The [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/) (OSF), COSâ€™s flagship product, is a web application that connects and supports the research workflow, enabling scientists to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of their research and increase the inclusivity.
