The [Connected and Open Research Ethics (CORE)](http://thecore.ucsd.edu/) aims to establish a set of guidelines to foster the ethical design and review of studies that use Mobile Imaging, pervasive Sensing, Social media, and Tracking (MISST) Technologies. Our goal is to build a web-based platform that will support access to resources designed to assist researchers in developing ethically sound studies and assist IRBs in the evaluation of studies that use MISST technologies.
