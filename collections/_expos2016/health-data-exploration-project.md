[HDE](http://hdexplore.calit2.net/) is paving the way for using personal data for the public good. Our core staff and our network members are producing new knowledge, new approaches, and new technologies. These projects demonstrate the value of using personal data in research and create reusable templates, policies, and infrastructures for using new forms of data.
