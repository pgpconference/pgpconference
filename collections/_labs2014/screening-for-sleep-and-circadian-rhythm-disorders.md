Sleep occupies a substantial portion of our lives and is increasingly being recognized for its role in cardiovascular disease, cancer, memory, safety and performance, and all-cause mortality. Yet we have been sleeping in potentially maladaptive situations since the invention of the light bulb, in a society increasingly reliant on shift-work and 24-hour connectivity.

Despite connections to a broad range of physiology, the genetics of sleep remain poorly understood. Questionnaire screening for sleep and circadian rhythm disorders can establish a baseline to quantify relationships with other measured non-sleep traits, generate pilot data and methods for future well-powered studies, and provide state-of-the-art data for areas with minimal genetic study (e.g. owl-lark preference). Our multi-disciplinary team has expertise in sleep, circadian rhythms, and quantitative genomics. We are currently working on multiple projects, including the largest genetic meta-analysis study of obstructive sleep apnea to date.
