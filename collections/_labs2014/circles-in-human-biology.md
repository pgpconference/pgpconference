The age of personalized genomics offers an unprecedented chance to understand the biology of uniquely human traits. One interesting and understudied human-specific trait is the areola, a circle of specialized, pigmented skin surrounding the human nipple. Areolas have been proposed to play an intriguing role in human evolution; different features of the areola have been linked to sexual selection, nursing behavior, and infant weight gain. Developmentally, circular markings have a simple genetic architecture. This means that studying areolas can help us learn about the genetic underpinnings of distinctively human traits, while also laying important groundwork for improving breast and infant health.

The Tabin Laboratory at Harvard Medical School has engaged more than 200 participants from the Personal Genome Project to share data about their areolas as part of our effort to learn about the causes and consequences of diversity in this uniquely human trait. Using this data we have made several important discoveries: one, areolas are much more diverse than was previously recognized; and two, we now know that multiple, independent genetic pathways are responsible for the size and glandular structure of the areola.

We invite all PGP participants (both male and female) to join us in our effort to identify the genes responsible for variation in the appearance and glandular structure of the areola. Participation takes place in two parts. First, participants complete an online survey about health factors that could influence areola appearance, including weight, parity and breastfeeding history, hormonal status, etc. Second, participants perform a breast and areola self-characterization wherein they take measurements and photographs of their areolas (this is performed in the privacy of your own home). All measurements and images belong to participants and can be shared as you choose. In addition, all data will be uploaded to our secure server for analysis.

Please visit our 2014 GET Lab booth to pick up your areola self-characterization kit and to hear what we have been learning about the fascinating human areola. Not coming to GET Labs? We still want your help! If you are interested in participating in Circles, please read about the study and request a study kit by mail [here](https://my.pgp-hms.org/third_party/12) (must be a Harvard PGP participant to access).
