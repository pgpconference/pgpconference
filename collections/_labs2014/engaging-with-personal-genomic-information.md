With your help, we aim to improve the design of websites and tools that make personal genomic information more accessible and understandable by the general public. We are academic researchers in the field of Human Computer Interaction that study opportunities and challenges for applying advanced HCI techniques in the area of personal genomics. We seek to learn more about the motivations, attitudes, and needs of users engaging with their personal genomic information. Thus, we look for volunteers who have already spent some time studying their own personal genomic data and want to tell us about their experiences.

We also plan to examine what human-computer interaction and visualization techniques and can help people to learn and generate new meaningful knowledge from their personal and family data. More specifically, we will explore how to design tools that enhance peopleâ€™s understanding of their genomic data and help users to leverage the predictive mechanism of human health and disease, as well as how to design computational environments that facilitate novel models of collaboration between citizen and professional scientists, broadening the participation of the public in genomic investigations.(image credit: [flickr user irglover](http://www.flickr.com/photos/irglover/7096373457/sizes/c/))
