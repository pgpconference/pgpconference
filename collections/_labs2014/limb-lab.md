Our hands shape our interactions with the world. They let us throw, touch, and manipulate objects in intricate ways. In cultures all around the world, people use their hands to greet each other and to communicate without speaking. Research has begun to reveal how animal limbs evolve and develop, but human hands are unique and remain mysterious. Compared to our nearest primate relatives, we have short fingers, long thumbs and special grip capabilities. We want to understand how these unique human traits are built. What are the genes that enabled the evolution of human limbs? What causes variation in hand bone growth and development? How do we come to have hands that are definitively human and yet distinct in each of us?

This year at GET, we are offering all participants a chance to enroll in the Limb Lab, a new research study of diversity in human hand and limb characteristics. We will perform on-site analyses of hands, arms and legs using non-invasive technologies, including photography, scanning/photocopying, and bone length measurements. Please stop by and let your hands do the talking as you help us unlock the mysteries of how human bodies are built.

Not coming to GET? If you are interested in participating in the Limb Lab after GET2014, please email: awark@genetics.med.harvard.edu (Note: all participation must take place in Boston)
