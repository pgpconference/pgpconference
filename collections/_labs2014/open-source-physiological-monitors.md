Technologies for rudimentary physiological sensing are becoming cheaper and easier to implement, leading to a proliferation of start-ups in the quantified self and body sensor spaces. To accelerate progress, we are developing well-documented open-source hardware and software platforms to enable the integration and customization of multiple sensing modalities for long-term monitoring. We will present a functional open source EKG which can be adapted for EEG or EMG measurements, as well as early prototypes of a BlueTooth compatible Bio-Glasses ([www.bioglasses.org](http://bioglasses.org/)) platform that integrates three or more physiological sensors, as well as motion monitoring, into a pair of glasses. These systems are fully open and are designed allow creative modification by non-engineers.
