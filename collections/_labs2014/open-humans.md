Open Humans is a new project by PersonalGenomes.org to transform data sharing in human health and biology. Drawing on our work with the Personal Genome Project and GET Labs, Open Humans aims to facilitate two types of sharing: researchers sharing data with participants, and participants aggregating and sharing data publicly. We think this idea has the potential to make a huge impact. Involution Studios is helping us gather vital feedback from both researchers and participants from this amazing community. Please help us design this exciting project by joining us for a 30 minute interview! Learn more about Open Humans at our new website: [www.openhumans.org](http://www.openhumans.org)
