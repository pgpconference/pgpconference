We live in the age of DNA sequencing, and yet there is an animal for which we have almost no DNA sequence even though it seems to be living closely with almost every one of us. This animal is literally right under our noses, as well as pretty much everywhere else on our faces. Mites of the genus Demodex make their homes in the pores and hair follicles of almost every adult, coming out at night to move around and breed. They have been long known among dermatologists and veterinarians for their association with rosacea and mange. However, their small size and elusive lifestyle have made it difficult to get a comprehensive understanding of our symbiotic mites. We aim to change this. We are collecting Demodex mites from both humans and non-humans, using DNA sequence data to look at the evolutionary relationships among the mites from different host and different parts of the body, and examining the microbial symbionts of the mites and their potential relationship to associated skin conditions. We are particularly interested in sampling people from other countries and people with conditions like blepheritis and rosacea. Sampling PGP participants will be a great opportunity to examine Demodex populations in the context of all the valuable information that participants have made available.
