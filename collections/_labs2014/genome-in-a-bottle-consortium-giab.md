As new high-throughput DNA sequencing methods are moving into clinical applications, understanding accuracy of genome sequencing instruments and methods will be critical. Numerous recent studies have demonstrated that analyzing the same sample on different sequencing technologies and bioinformatics analysis methods can yield very different results. There is a clear need for reference materials and quality metrics that may be used by device manufacturers and clinical laboratories to calibrate their machines and improve their operations.

With help from the Genome in a Bottle Consortium (www.genomeinabottle.org) and the FDA, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is developing well-characterized whole human genomes as Reference Materials. Research and clinical laboratories will be able to purchase and use these Reference Materials to understand and improve the performance of their DNA sequencing operations and bioinformatics methods.

The NIST "Genome in a Bottle" Consortium has partnered with PersonalGenomes.org and the Harvard Personal Genome Project (PGP) to identify well-consented participants interesting in contributing to this important effort. Specimens donated by PGP volunteers are viewed as ideal candidates to serve as these new reference standards due to the depth and availability of public PGP datasets as well as the strength of the "open consent" process used in the Harvard PGP study. In particular, the Harvard PGP consent process addresses the risk of re-identification and enables the commercial use of donated tissues.
