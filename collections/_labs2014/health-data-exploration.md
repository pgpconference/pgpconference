We are exploring the intersection of personal data and public science. There is considerable scientific value in making new forms of health data from wearable devices, smartphones, genetic testing, and other tools available to researchers in medicine, public health, and the social and behavioral sciences. Moreover, wider availability of these data might spark a new cadre of “citizen scientists” who can add to what traditional health researchers do. But for a variety of reasons it is not obvious how to make these data available for research. Issues to be addressed include whether there are unique scientific, methodological or ethical issues involved in such research; how to handle intellectual property of research findings; how and where these data intersect with other forms of medical and public health data; data quality; and privacy and confidentiality.

In order to better understand the experiences and concerns of individuals who share their data for scientific research, we will conduct a survey of GET Conference participants. We will also be conducting short interviews with participants during the event to gain a richer understanding of motivations for and concerns about participating in open science. Survey data and anonymized interview transcripts will be made publicly available. The results of this research will help shape research policy as well as the design of infrastructures for scientific data sharing.
