The Parametric Human Project is a collaborative international not-for-profit effort of scientists working together to greatly advance the state-of-the-art for medical research through the development of a digital human model that can serve as the basis for a vast collection of innovative applications. Our goal is to create a complete morphological and physiological multiscale human model through the systematic modeling of all aspects of human properties and processes.
