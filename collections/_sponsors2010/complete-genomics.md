Complete Genomics
Founded in 2006, Complete Genomics is a California company that has developed a novel approach to sequencing human DNA that is revolutionizing the human genome sequencing industry. Complete Genomics combines its proprietary third-generation DNA sequencing technology with its high-performance computing capabilities to deliver low-cost, high-quality genomic data on an unprecedented scale. The company is currently building the worldâ€™s largest human genome sequencing center. This development will allow academic and biopharmaceutical researchers, for the first time, to conduct large-scale complete human genome studies that will help identify the genetic underpinnings of complex diseases and drug responses.
