Eventbrite

Eventbrite is the world's largest, fastest growing social commerce company. We empower anyone to host successful live experiences of any type or size by providing an easy way to manage, promote and sell out the event. Eventbrite brings together transactions with social interactions to allow events to live, flourish and take flight anywhere online. The net result is an intensely social transaction experience that at once helps events sell out, while creating a whirlwind of conversation and social engagement around them. Eventbrite is the engine for a new generation of live experiences. Eventbrite is privately held and backed by Sequoia Capital.
