Justin Knight Photography
Great event photography is an art. It is the art of anticipating moments; of combining light and form to create images that resonate. It is the art of translating a story, its characters, and the spirit of an event into a visual medium. It requires split-second choices: to unobtrusively capture a moment or orchestrate it? It means deploying the right approach or a new technique, all through an experienced eye. Justin Knight Photography has served the Greater Boston area for 15 years. He specializes in portrait, project, and event photography.
