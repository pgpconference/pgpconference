Peter K. Gregersen, MD is Director of the Robert S. Boas Center for Genomics and Human Genetics at the Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, located within the North Shore LIJ Health System. He has been a leader in the genetic analysis of human autoimmune disorders, having founded or collaborated on major international consortia on the genetics of rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus, myasthenia gravis, myositis and many others. These and related projects have catalyzed the formation of many population resources based at the Feinstein Institute that enable the study of genotype-phenotype relationships in both normal and disease affected subjects. Over the last decade, he has also focused on the genetics of rare cognitive traits including absolute pitch, synesthesia and other aspects of musical perception.
