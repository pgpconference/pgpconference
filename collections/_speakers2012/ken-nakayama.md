Ken Nakayama, PhD is the Edgar Pierce Professor of Psychology at Harvard University. He studies vision. How do we see? What is it about the ever changing structure of light impinging on our mobile eyes that enables us to pick up information about the environment around us? What is it about our brain and its neural activity allows us to see so much and so effortlessly? How is it that we can control our eyes and bodies to seek out information and to act in the physical world? Recently, he has embarked on research program to understand the perception and recognition of faces.
