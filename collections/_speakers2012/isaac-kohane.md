Isaac Kohane, MD, PhD is a professor at Harvard Medical School who applies computational techniques, whole genome analysis, and functional genomics to study human diseases through the developmental lens, and particularly through the use of animal model systems. Specific diseases of interest are neurodevelopmental disorders and carcinogenesis. The use of whole healthcare systems as “living laboratories” to drive discovery research in the genomic area compliments his basic research agenda by providing population-level study tools.
