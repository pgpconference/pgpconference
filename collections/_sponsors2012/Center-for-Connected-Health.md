The Center for Connected Health is working to create a new model for healthcare delivery, by developing programs and innovative strategies to move care from the hospital or doctor’s office into the day-to-day lives of patients. Leveraging information technology -- cell phones, computers, networked devices, and simple remote health monitoring tools -- the Center is helping providers and patients manage chronic conditions, maintain health and wellness, and improve adherence, engagement and clinical outcomes. The Center for Connected Health is a division of Partners HealthCare in Boston, founded by Brigham and Women’s and Massachusetts General Hospitals.
