Nathan Pearson is Principal Genome Scientist at QIAGEN, where he and his colleagues build and apply tools that smartly interpret human genomes, in order to help researchers understand disease, drug response, and other phenotypes. Through computer, lab, and fieldwork with fellow scientists -- and with genome-curious layfolk such as historian Henry Louis Gates, Jr. and rocker Ozzy Osbourne -- he has sought to cast light on how human genetic variation reflects key aspects of our health and history. He tweets @GenomeNathan, and blogs at Genomena.com..
