Esther Dyson (@edyson on twitter) is PGP research subject #3 and the founder of HICCup.co, for Health Initiative Coordinating Council. HICCup has just launched The Way to Wellville [at www.hiccup.co], an open-source, evidence-generating project devoted to defining and testing models for producing community health (not health care) that will return profits to investors and health to the participants. It will use a contest in order to entice the best communities to compete and to give their successes and (educational) failures visibility. Its slogan: "Five places, five metrics, five years!" Aside from that, Dyson spends her time investing in and nurturing start-ups, with a recent focus on health care and aerospace. She is an investor in 23andMe (also a director), Applied Proteomics, Crohnology, Eligible API, Genomera, GeriJoy, Health Loop, HealthTap, i2Dx, Keas (also an advisor), Medivo, mEquilibrium, Omada Health, Organized Wisdom, PatientsLikeMe, PatientsKnowBest (UK), Resilient, Sleepio (UK), StartupHealth, Tocagen, Valkee (Finland), VitaPortal (Russia, also an advisor) and Voxiva (also a director).
