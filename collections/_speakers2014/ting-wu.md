Ting (C.-ting) Wu is a Professor of Genetics at Harvard Medical School. Her interests center on how chromosome behavior influences inheritance and, to this end, her laboratory invents and applies technologies that reveal how chromosomes interact with each other. Her talk will focus on a remarkable and puzzling set of sequences, called ultraconserved elements, which have resisted change for hundreds of millions of years. She recently co-hosted a symposium on Genetics, Biomedicine, and the Human Experience in Space and will bring some of that flavor to her talk. She is also the Director of the Personal Genetics Education Project (pgEd.org). pgEd works to accelerate public awareness of the benefits as well as implications of learning the details of oneâ€™s genome, engaging the public through schools, conferences, the entertainment industry (film and television), museums, and a mobile game (Map-Ed.org). She received her B.A. and Ph.D. from Harvard University and is a recent awardee of an NIH Director's Pioneer Award.
