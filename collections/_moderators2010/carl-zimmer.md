Carl Zimmer has been called \"as fine a science essayist as we have\" by the New York Times Book Review. In his books, essays, articles, and blog posts, Zimmer reports from the frontiers of biology, where scientists are expanding our understanding of life. He is a frequent guest on radio programs, such as \"Fresh Air\" and \"This American Life.\" Zimmer is a lecturer at Yale University, where he teaches writing about science and the environment. He is also the first Visiting Scholar at the Science, Health, and Environment Reporting Program at New York University's Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute. He is, to his knowledge, the only writer after which a species of tapeworm has been named.
