Geniaâ€™s mission is to make genetic information universally available. Its integrated circuits and proprietary NanoTag chemistry enable massively parallel single-molecule DNA sequencing. This versatile nanopore-based platform allows for single molecule, electrical, real-time analysis without the need for complicated optics, labels, amplification, or fluidics. By developing a true integrated circuit on standard semiconductor process technology, Genia's sequencing platform enables the use of molecular diagnostics in everyday clinical care.
