At TestMyBrain, we are interested in a few main questions:
is a collaboration between psychologists and brain scientists at Harvard University and Massachusetts General Hospital aimed at understanding the human mind. TestMyBrain is dedicated to collaborating with citizen scientists around the world, by providing tools that allow people to test themselves on a range of cognitive functions. Scientists then use that data to learn more about cognition and how the brain works. Since 2008, 750,000 volunteers have taken part in TestMyBrain experiments and TestMyBrain has become an engine for research, education, and scientific discovery.

<div style="padding-left: 20px;">(1) How do basic cognitive functions vary between individuals?
(2) How do these differences impact us in our day-to-day lives?
(3) What is the relationship between these variations and our personality, mental health, and who we are as individuals?</div>

We invite you to come and take some of our tests, either online at [http://www.testmybrain.org](http://www.testmybrain.org) or at the conference. For individuals attending the conference, we will provide tests of face recognition ability, emotion perception, mental quickness, visual memory, and/or sensitivity to visual changes. Come and visit us at the GET conference to get your brain profile and discuss your results! You can also contact Dr. Laura Germine at testmybrain@gmail.com for more information about the TestMyBrain project, our mission, and the discoveries we've already made based on the contributions of people like you.
