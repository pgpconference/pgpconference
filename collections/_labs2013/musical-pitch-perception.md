Ever wonder about your sense of musical pitch? The research app, PitchMatch!, was created by Dr. Peter K. Gregersen at The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research in New York in order to understand variation in musical pitch perception and innate musical ability in the general population. Dr. Gregersen has been studying the epidemiology and genetics of absolute pitch (a rare musical ability) for over a decade.

This free app, designed in a friendly game format, tests for the absolute pitch trait as well as overall pitch perception ability in the general population. This has never been done before. No musical training or experience is required â€“ whether you play a musical instrument or not, you may be able to do well at PitchMatch! Those interested in learning more about the research behind the app (iPhone/iPad compatible), may contact us at our website, [www.absolutepitchstudy.com/pitchmatch.html](http://www.absolutepitchstudy.com/pitchmatch.html). Please visit us during the 2013 GET Conference near the PGP participant blood draw registration table to learn more about PitchMatch!. A demo will be available for anyone who would like to try it out. (Image thanks to flickr user [horiavarian](http://www.flickr.com/photos/horiavarlan/4329908160/))
