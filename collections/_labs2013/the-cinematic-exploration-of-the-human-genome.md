is a film festival that will be part of the 2014 G.E.T. Conference. The festival will not only screen films that relate to genetic science but will reach out to filmmakers and actively encourage them to make new short films that explore the ideas, research, and issues being generated by modern genetics. These short films will be screened as part of next years festival and will be made public to provide a point of entry for anyone curious to learn more about this scientific frontier. The goal is to build a collection films that will help engage and educate the public.

We are looking to collect ideas for short films from you and everyone attending this years G.E.T. Conference. Ideas that will give filmmakers a solid foundation to start from and clear direction as they explore this subject. We want as a diverse a collection of short films as possible: documentaries, speculative fiction, profiles or researchers, science fiction, history, drama, musicals, comediesâ€¦this a community wide brainstorming session, and there can be no bad ideas. Postcards will be available at the conference for you to write your suggestions on, and at any time you can send ideas to: filmfest@fieldtest.us
