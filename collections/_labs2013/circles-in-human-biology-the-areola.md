The age of personalized genomics offers an unprecedented chance to understand the biology of uniquely human traits. One interesting and understudied human-specific trait is the areola, a circle of specialized, pigmented skin surrounding the human nipple. Areolas have been proposed to play an intriguing role in human evolution; differences in areola morphology have been linked to sexual attractiveness, nursing behavior, and infant weight gain. Developmentally, circular markings have a simple genetic architecture, making the areola both an interesting and a practical case study into the genetic underpinnings of distinctively human traits.

The Tabin Laboratory at Harvard Medical School invites all PGP participants (_both male and female_) to join us in our effort to learn about the causes and consequences of diversity in the human areola. Our goal is to identify the genes responsible for variation in the appearance and glandular structure of the areola. Participation takes place in two parts. First, participants will fill out an online survey about health factors that could influence areola appearance, including weight, parity and breastfeeding history, hormonal status, etc. Next, participants will perform a breast and areola self-characterization wherein they will take measurements and photographs of their areolas (self-characterization can be performed at home). Measurements and images will be uploaded to our secure server for analysis. All results will be made available to participants at the conclusion of the study.

Please visit us at the 2013 GET Conference to pick up your areola self-characterization kit and to learn more about the fascinating human areola.
