Humans have around 400 different odorant receptors which they use to sense the olfactory environment. The family of odorant receptors is the largest gene family in the human genome and its members are exceptionally genetically and functionally variable. As a consequence, everybody smells the world with a different set of functional odorant receptors and it therefore smells different to each individual. The most prominent variability is seen in a condition called specific anosmia. People with specific anosmia have a normal sense of smell but cannot smell a specific type of odors (like vanilla or musk). The most widely known case of specific anosmia is to an odor released by urine after asparagus ingestion: most people can smell this odors, but some cannot. The phenotyping for olfactory perception by Andreas Keller from the Rockefeller University is relatively simple. Participants will sniff a few odors and answer questions about them ("How strong is the odor?", "How pleasant is the odor?", etc.) on a computer screen.
