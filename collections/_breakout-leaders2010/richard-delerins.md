Richard C. Delerins, Ph.D. is a Faculty Fellow and a Research Scholar at UCLA and at the Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales (EHESS), Paris. As an academic, his work focuses on Cuisine, Nutrition and Health. His research deals with the concept of \"nutritive strategies\": how diets and cuisines are connected to the function of the body, including longevity, aging, strength, intellectual capacities and prevention of pathologies (obesity, type 2 diabetes). As a Chef, he explores the challenges of 21st century cuisines, preserving the environment and culinary traditions that relate to both identity and migratory patterns and the simultaneously nutrigenomic challenge of feeding our taste buds in consonance with our genes. Currently Richard C. Delerins is pioneering (as Principal Investigator) a project on \"21st century Cuisine, Nutrition and Genetics in France and the United States.\" It involves geneticists, biostatisticians, nutritionists, public health scientists, anthropologists, historians of food, and chefs working at different scales of biology and culture, to nurture new methods and new pedagogies at the intersection of genetics, nutrition and cuisine.
