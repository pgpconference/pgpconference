Ever since Antonie van Leeuwenhoek discovered a vast diversity of microbes between his own teeth in the 17th century using a primitive microscope, the microbes inhabiting our bodies have fascinated us. In the last few years, radical advances in DNA sequencing have allowed us to examine—for the first time—the full extent of microbial diversity on or in our bodies and to explore possible linkages between microbes and a wide range of health and disease states. At [American Gut](http://americangut.org/), the gut is our main focus, but we also look at oral, skin and even vaginal microbial communities.
