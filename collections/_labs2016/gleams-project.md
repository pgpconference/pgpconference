Alzheimerâ€™s Disease and other forms of progressive cognitive impairment are world-wide and growing phenomena of epidemic proportion as our populations age. The underlying causes are poorly understood, but are thought to represent a complex interaction between various gene sets and environmental factors. To date there have been no really efficacious treatments to alleviate the symptoms or delay the progression of disease. The Genomic Longitudinal Environmental Aging Memory Study or [GLEAMS](http://www.neurol.org/research-gleams.html) proposes to systematically study volunteers aged 46-75 years old from the Harvard Personal Genome Project PGP and other genome sequence studies looking for causes and cures for these late-life dementias.
