[Silent Spring Institute](http://www.silentspring.org/) is launching a crowdfunded biomonitoring study to learn more about how people are exposed to environmental chemicals. Participants will submit a urine sample for analysis that will be tested for a group of chemicals including antimicrobials, parabens, and phthalates and will receive a report of their results. We will use these data to characterize the publicâ€™s exposure to toxic chemicals, identify predictors of high exposure, and find the best ways to avoid exposure.
