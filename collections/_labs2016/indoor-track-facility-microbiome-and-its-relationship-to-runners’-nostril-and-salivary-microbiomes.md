The goals of ‘Indoor Track Facility Microbiome and its Relationship to Runners’ Nostril and Salivary Microbiomes’ are twofold. First, to define the microbiome of a previously unexplored built indoor environment: Indoor track facilities. Second, to identify the nostril and salivary microbiomes of runners who train indoors versus outdoors. This study is being carried out in Greater Boston, a temperate climate that contains 3 of the 22 Elite Development Clubs of the USA Track and Field (USATF), more than any other location.
