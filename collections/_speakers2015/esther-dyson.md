**Esther Dyson** is PGP research subject #3 and the founder of [hiccup.co](http://www.hiccup.co), for Health Initiative Coordinating Council. HICCup runs The Way to Wellville [at [hiccup.co](image: http://www.hiccup.co)], an open-source, evidence-generating accelerator devoted to defining and implementing proven models for producing community health (not health care) that will return profits to investors and health to participants. The accelerator is working with five US communities over the next five years to accelerate their efforts and give their successes and (educational) failures visibility. Its slogan: “Don’t rent your health. Invest in it!" Aside from that, Dyson spends her time investing in and nurturing start-ups, with recent focus on health care and aerospace. She is an investor in 23andMe (also a director), Applied Proteomics, CUR, Eligible API, Genomera, GeriJoy, Health Loop, Health Tap, i2Dx, Keas (also an advisor), Medivo, mEquilibrium, Omada Health, PatientsLikeMe, PatientsKnowBest (UK), Resilient, Sleepio (UK), StartupHealth, Tocagen, Valkee (Finland), Vital Score, VitaPortal (Russia, also an advisor) and Voxiva (also a director).
