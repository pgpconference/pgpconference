**Steven Keating** is a doctoral candidate at the MIT Media Lab who is developing novel platforms for 3D printing, synthetic biological fabrication, and designed growth of the next generation of products. Curiosity drives his research and also saved his life through the accidental discovery of a baseball-sized cancerous brain tumor found in a voluntary academic scan. With his tumor successfully removed through awake brain surgery in 2014, Steven is an advocate for open patient data and curiosity. He is currently pursuing a PhD in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Synthetic Biology. Past research projects cover a diverse range from building-scale 3D printing, to microfluidics for synthetic biology, and interactive methods to explore his own brain tumor data. From gears to genomes, he is interested in exploring new design possibilities and open health data networks. Calgary is his hometown and he is invigorated by creativity, design, and maple syrup.
