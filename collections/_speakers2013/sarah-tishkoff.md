Sarah Tishkoff, PhD is the David and Lyn Silfen University Professor in Genetics and Biology at the University of Pennsylvania. Dr. Tishkoff studies genomic variation in ethnically diverse Africans. Her research examines African population history and how genetic variation can affect a wide range of practical issues â€“ for example, why humans have different susceptibility to disease, how they metabolize drugs, and how they adapt through evolution. Dr. Tishkoff is a recipient of an NIH Pioneer Award, a David and Lucile Packard Career Award, a Burroughs/Wellcome Fund Career Award and a Penn Integrates Knowledge (PIK) endowed chair.
