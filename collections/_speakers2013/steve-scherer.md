His group has discovered numerous disease susceptibility genes and most recently has defined CNV and other genetic factors underlying autism. He collaborated with Craig Venter's team to decode human chromosome 7 and to generate the first genome sequence of an individual. Some 300 scientific papers document his work (cited >20,000 times).
