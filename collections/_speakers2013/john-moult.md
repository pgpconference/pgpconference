John Moult D.Phil. is a professor in the Institute for Bioscience and Biotechnology Research and the Department of Cell Biology and Molecular Genetics at the University of Maryland. He leads a research program in the area of the relationship between genetic variation and disease, with an emphasis on elucidating underlying molecular mechanisms. He has a long-standing interest in community-based strategies for scientific research, and is co-founder of CAGI (Critical Assessment of Genome Interpretation). CAGI is an organization that conducts community experiments to objectively evaluate computational methods for relating genetic information to phenotype, particularly the relationship between human genetic variation and disease. An aim of CAGI is to help clinicians and the broader community appreciate the strengths and limitations of variant interpretation methods, so aiding their appropriate application. A current CAGI challenge is to match each of a set of Personal Genome Project genomes to the corresponding phenotypic profiles, requiring the integration of the full range of genetic signatures.
