Marc Salit is leading a group at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) dedicated to technology development and measurement infrastructure (standards, reference data, predictive models) for massively multiplexed genome-scale measurement methods. This "Multiplexed Biomolecular Science" group is a multidisciplinary team growing out of work to address microarray measurement science issues, and a long-running effort in technology and measurement science in microfluidics. Marc has worked extensively in measurement science in chemistry and physics, with emphasis on precision measurements, lab automation, algorithm development, measurement uncertainty, traceability, and standards development. His research is now focused on bringing experience from the chemical metrology community to the emerging biometrology community.
