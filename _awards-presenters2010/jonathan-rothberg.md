Jonathan Rothberg is the founder, CEO and Chairman of Ion Torrent. He is best known for pioneering high-speed, massively parallel DNA sequencing. The idea for massively parallel DNA sequencing/next gen sequencing came to him after his infant son was rushed to intensive care and he realized how critical individual genome sequencing was to human health. He subsequently founded 454 Life Sciences, bringing to market the first new method for sequencing genomes since Sanger and Gilbert won the Nobel prize in 1980. Jonathan\'s invention introduced the era of personal genomes and is now in use at major pharmaceutical companies, universities, genome centers, and medical centers around the world.
