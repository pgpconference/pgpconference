# About

The GET Conference is an annual event that brings together leading thinkers to discuss the important ways in which personal genomes will affect all of our lives in the coming years and to debate the technical, commercial, and societal impacts of new genomic technologies.

Annual GET Conference events are organized by PersonalGenomes.org, a 501(c)(3) charitable organization whose mission is to serve as both the pioneer and the global ambassador of emerging genomic technologies and knowledge that will positively impact the health and well-being of humankind.
