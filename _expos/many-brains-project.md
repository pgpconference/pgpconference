The [Many Brains Project](http://www.manybrains.net/) is a nonprofit organization dedicated to accelerating research on the mind and brain by developing research tools that directly address the needs of patients and participants. We develop state-of-the-art, digital, open source tools for assessing cognition and brain health, all validated through our research platform TestMyBrain.org. You can participate in our interactive lab here at the GET conference, or come talk to us if you would like to know how to incorporate mobile / web-based, participant-centered cognitive testing into your work.
