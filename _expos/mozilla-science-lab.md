[Mozilla Science Lab](https://www.mozillascience.org/) (a program of the Mozilla Foundation) works to make research more collaborative, accessible, and usable. We do this by empowering the next generation of leaders through fellowships and mentorship, facilitating project-based learning around open data and open source, and supporting and advocating for a growing community of researchers working openly. We believe a community of peers working, learning and building together are necessary to further research online.
