Dana Pe'er is assistant professor at the Department of Biological Sciences at Columbia and is one of the leading researchers in computational systems biology. In her Ph.D. (Computer Science) at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem (with Nir Friedman), Dana pioneered the use of machine learning to uncover the structure and function of molecular networks from genomics data, based on Bayesian networks. She subsequently did a postdoc with George Church at Harvard Medical School and there she began to work towards understanding of how genetic variation alters the regulatory network between individuals and subsequently manifests in phenotypic diversity. This is now the focus of Dana's lab at Columbia University, where she and her team are developing methods to infer how variation in sequence modulates signal processing and is manifested in cellular phenotypes, with applications towards personalized cancer treatment. Dana is recipient of the Burroughs Wellcome Fund Career Award, NIH Directors New Innovator Award and a Packard Fellow in Science and Engineering.
