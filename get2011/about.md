# About the 2011 GET Conference

The second annual GET Conference was held April 27, 2011 at the University of Pennsylvania\'s new Translational Research Center in Philadelphia as part of a week-long celebration honoring George Church, recipient of the 2011 Bower Award and Prize for Achievement in Science.

The GET Conference is an annual event that brings together leading thinkers to discuss the important ways in which personal genomes will affect all of our lives in the coming years and to debate the technical, commercial, and societal impacts of new genomic technologies. The conference takes place each year in late April around the National DNA Day holiday.

Annual GET Conference events are organized by PersonalGenomes.org, a 501(c)(3) charitable organization whose mission is to serve as both the pioneer and the global ambassador of emerging genomic technologies and knowledge that will positively impact the health and well-being of humankind.
