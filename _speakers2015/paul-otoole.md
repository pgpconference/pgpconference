**Paul Oâ€™Toole** is Professor of Microbial Genomics at University College Cork, Ireland following industry and academic positions in Sweden, Canada, New Zealand and the US. His main research theme is the genomics of gastrointestinal bacteria in humans with emphasis on commensal species. In recent years he has co-ordinated and participated in several major projects that examine the composition and function of the gut microbiota, its reaction to habitual diet, and its relationship to health, functional gastrointestinal disorders, and ageing. The ultimate aim of these investigations is to develop novel therapeutics, foods and food ingredients to programme the intestinal microbiota towards promoting health. He co-ordinated ELDERMET (eldermet.ucc.ie), a nationally funded project that established diet-microbiota health interactions in 500 elderly persons, and he leads a project called ELDERFOOD that is investigating dairy-derived foods for healthy aging. He is a Principal Investigator in the Alimentary Pharmabiotic Centre (apc.ucc.ie), in which he leads projects on microbiota in aging, and lactobacillus genomics. He leads the metagenomics work package in NuAge, an EU FP7 project on microbiota in the elderly that is anchored by University of Bologna. He is a partner in MyNewGut, another European Union project on gut microbiota, diet and behaviour in infants anchored by CSIC Valencia.
