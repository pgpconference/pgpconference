# About the 2010 GET Conference

The first annual GET Conference was held April 27, 2010 in Cambridge, MA.

With the rapid growth in personal genome sequencing, the GET Conference 2010 marked the last chance in history to collect everyone with a personal genome sequence on the same stage. We brought together more than a dozen genome pioneers to share their experiences and discuss the important ways in which personal genomes will affect all of our lives in the coming years.

## Thank You for Making 2010 a Success!

We would like to thank all of our speakers, sponsors, moderators and attendees for making the GET Conference 2010 a resounding success. For us, the GET Conference offered a glimpse into the past, present and future of personal genomes, and sparked a number of exciting conversations. We hope it did for you as well.
