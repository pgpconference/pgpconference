# Thank You for Making GET Conference 2010 a Success!

We would like to thank all of our speakers, sponsors, moderators and attendees for making the GET Conference 2010 a resounding success. For us, the GET Conference offered a glimpse into the past, present and future of personal genomes, and sparked a number of exciting conversations. We hope it did for you as well.

If you were unable to attend the GET Conference, or would just like to revisit it, you may check out the [photos](http://arep.med.harvard.edu/PGP/GET/) or visit our [press page](http://www.getconference.org/get2010/press.html), where we have collected a range of articles covering the conference. See also, the collection of [real-time Twitter coverage](http://www.genomicslawreport.com/index.php/2010/04/28/get2010-edition-of-weekly-twitter-roundup/) of the GET Conference provided by several of our attendees.

We will be posting video from the conference once they are available. If you'd like to share your thoughts about the GET Conference 2010, or suggestions for next year's event, please [contact us](http://www.getconference.org/get2010/contact.html).
