Fever is one of the most common signs of illness, and its presence causes anxiety to many. It can also indicate the presence of other medical conditions, including autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases. Surprisingly, 150 years after temperature became a “vital sign” taken at every medical encounter, we still know very little about fever. [Feverprints](http://feverprints.com/) aims to understand how body temperatures differ between individuals of different backgrounds, ages, sizes, gender and time of day in order to redefine what “normal” and “febrile” temperatures are. Secondly, we seek to identify specific fever patterns (“feverprints”) for different illnesses that will allow doctors to make quicker and more accurate diagnoses. Finally, we look to determine the effect of antipyretics (medicines to decrease fever) on the severity and length of an illness.
