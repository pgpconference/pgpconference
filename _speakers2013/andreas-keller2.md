Andreas Keller, PhD is a research associate in the Laboratory of Neurogenetics and Behavior at the Rockefeller University in New York and a graduate student in the Department of Philosophy at the City University of New York. At Rockefeller University Andreas studies the perceptual and behavioral consequences of variability in human odorant receptors. The human odorant receptor gene family is the largest gene family in the human genome and its members show remarkable genetic and functional variability. The sense of smell is therefore an excellent model for the study of genetic variability and its consequences in humans. Andreas is a Branco Weiss Fellow of the Society in Science Foundation and a NARSAD Young Investigator.
