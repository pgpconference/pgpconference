As Chief Instigator and CEO at Genomera, Greg Biggers helps fuel the participant-driven research movement. Where people move from subjects to participants. Where individuals grow from n=they to n=me to n=we. Where patients (Genomera just calls them people) drive the agenda and engage with one another to grow evidence more quickly than the traditional bottlenecks allow. Biggers also serves on the boards of Genetic Alliance, an elementary school, and a community development organization. When not working on the future of digital health, he can often be found sailing a Santana 22 on San Francisco Bay.
